# WechatDashboard Development Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Turn the current WPF/SQLite MVP into a practical desktop message dashboard with extensible capture sources for WeChat first, then Feishu, Shihuatong, DingTalk, and similar collaboration tools.

**Architecture:** Keep message ingestion behind `IMessageCaptureAdapter`. All adapters emit `CapturedMessage`, and `MessageCapturePipeline` performs deduplication, persistence, `@我` detection, project classification, urgency ranking, Todo creation, and offset updates. WPF consumes repositories and pipeline services rather than embedding platform-specific capture logic.

**Tech Stack:** .NET 10, WPF, SQLite via `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`, C# records/services, console test runner.

---

## Current State

Completed:

- WPF solution and layered project structure.
- Domain models for messages, Todo items, classifications, urgency scores, and project rules.
- Rule-based `@我` detection, project classification, urgency ranking, and Todo creation.
- SQLite schema initialization and repositories for messages, Todo items, and processing offsets.
- Generic capture contracts: `IMessageCaptureAdapter`, `CaptureContext`, `CaptureBatch`, `CapturedMessage`.
- `MessageCapturePipeline` that processes captured messages end to end.
- `JsonlDirectoryCaptureAdapter` for local JSONL ingestion with offset handling and append-safe reads.
- `CaptureSourceDefinition`, `CaptureSourceKind`, and `CaptureAdapterFactory` for multi-source registration.
- Default JSONL source registration for WeChat, Feishu, Shihuatong, and DingTalk.
- `WindowTextCaptureAdapter` core for parsing injected visible-window text snapshots.
- `WindowsUiAutomationSnapshotProvider` and `SystemWindowsAutomationReader` for reading Windows UI Automation top-level window snapshots.
- WPF capture diagnostics can scan WeChat visible windows and show UIA text previews without persisting messages.
- Disabled WeChat window-text source profile through `CaptureAdapterFactory.CreateWeChatWindowTextSource()`.
- WPF shell with refresh, seed sample data, and one-shot capture button.
- Tests covering core rules, SQLite round-trip, JSONL capture, and capture pipeline.
- Project targets .NET 10 to match the installed desktop runtime.

Known gaps:

- Real Windows UI Automation snapshot provider exists, but has not yet been validated against the actual WeChat desktop window.
- Windows notification listener is not implemented.
- Feishu, Shihuatong, and DingTalk adapters are not implemented.
- Project rules are hardcoded.
- Statistics are basic counts, not full charted dashboards.
- No installer, tray app, or background service mode yet.

## Milestone 1: Capture Source Registration

Purpose: make multiple message sources first-class without changing the pipeline each time a new software source is added.

**Files:**

- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Application/Capture/CaptureSourceDefinition.cs`
- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Application/Capture/CaptureSourceKind.cs`
- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Capture/CaptureAdapterFactory.cs`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.App/MainWindow.xaml.cs`
- Modify: `tests/WechatDashboard.Tests/Program.cs`
- Modify: `design/message-capture-extension.md`

- [x] Step 1: Write failing tests proving the factory creates adapters for WeChat, Feishu, Shihuatong, and DingTalk.
- [x] Step 2: Implement source definitions and a factory that maps `JsonlDirectory` definitions to `JsonlDirectoryCaptureAdapter`.
- [x] Step 3: Wire WPF to build the pipeline from the factory instead of hardcoding one adapter.
- [x] Step 4: Re-run tests and full solution build.

## Milestone 2: WeChat Visible Window Adapter

Purpose: capture user-visible WeChat desktop text without process injection or database decryption.

**Files:**

- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Capture/WindowTextCaptureAdapter.cs`
- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Capture/WindowTextCaptureOptions.cs`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure.csproj` if Windows UI Automation references are required.
- Modify: `tests/WechatDashboard.Tests/Program.cs`
- Modify: `design/message-capture-extension.md`

- [x] Step 1: Add tests around text normalization and stable source keys using injected window text snapshots.
- [x] Step 2: Implement a generic visible-window text adapter behind `IMessageCaptureAdapter`.
- [x] Step 3: Add a WeChat profile that matches WeChat window titles and emits `Source = "WeChat"`.
- [x] Step 4: Keep the adapter disabled by default until tested on the real desktop app.

Note: this milestone implements the testable visible-window adapter core and a disabled WeChat profile. The actual Windows UI Automation snapshot provider remains a separate follow-up because it must be verified against the real desktop app window.

## Milestone 3: Capture Source Settings UI

Purpose: let the user enable, disable, and inspect capture sources without editing code.

**Files:**

- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Domain/Entities/CaptureSourceSettings.cs`
- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Persistence/SqliteCaptureSourceSettingsRepository.cs`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Persistence/SqliteDatabaseInitializer.cs`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.App/MainWindow.xaml`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.App/MainWindow.xaml.cs`
- Modify: `tests/WechatDashboard.Tests/Program.cs`

- [ ] Step 1: Add tests for saving and loading enabled capture sources.
- [ ] Step 2: Add a `capture_source_settings` table.
- [ ] Step 3: Add a simple WPF settings view showing source name, adapter kind, path, and enabled state.
- [ ] Step 4: Build the capture pipeline from saved settings.

## Milestone 4: Project Rules and Alias Management

Purpose: remove hardcoded user aliases and project rules.

**Files:**

- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Persistence/SqliteProjectRuleRepository.cs`
- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Persistence/SqliteUserAliasRepository.cs`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Persistence/SqliteDatabaseInitializer.cs`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.App/MainWindow.xaml`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.App/MainWindow.xaml.cs`
- Modify: `tests/WechatDashboard.Tests/Program.cs`

- [ ] Step 1: Add repository tests for user aliases and project rules.
- [ ] Step 2: Store aliases in `user_aliases` and rules in `project_rules`.
- [ ] Step 3: Load aliases and rules into `MentionDetector` and `ProjectClassifier`.
- [ ] Step 4: Add WPF controls to add and remove aliases and rules.

## Milestone 5: Dashboard Expansion

Purpose: move from simple counters to usable multi-dimensional views.

**Files:**

- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Application/Analytics/DashboardSummaryService.cs`
- Create: `src/WechatDashboard.Application/Analytics/DashboardSummary.cs`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Persistence/SqliteMessageRepository.cs`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.Infrastructure/Persistence/SqliteTodoRepository.cs`
- Modify: `src/WechatDashboard.App/MainWindow.xaml`
- Modify: `tests/WechatDashboard.Tests/Program.cs`

- [ ] Step 1: Add tests for project, time, category, priority, and Todo status aggregations.
- [ ] Step 2: Implement dashboard summary queries or application aggregation.
- [ ] Step 3: Replace hardcoded WPF project summary logic with the analytics service.
- [ ] Step 4: Add charts after the data contract is stable.

## Verification Commands

Run these before committing any implementation change:

```powershell
dotnet build WechatDashboard.sln --no-restore -v minimal
dotnet run --project tests\WechatDashboard.Tests\WechatDashboard.Tests.csproj --no-restore
git status --short
```

Expected result:

- Build exits with code 0.
- Tests report all tests passed.
- The existing `MSB3101` warning about `obj` cache write permissions may appear in this environment; it is not a compile error.

## Immediate Next Work

Milestones 1 and 2 have been completed at the framework level. The app now has a capture diagnostics button for scanning WeChat visible-window UIA text previews. The next executable milestone is to run that diagnostic against the real WeChat desktop app, document the observed UIA text format, tune parsing rules if needed, and only then expose an enable switch in capture settings.
